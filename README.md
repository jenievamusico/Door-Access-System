# This script designs a door access security system that prompts the user to enter a passcode, and access is only granted if the passcode is correct.
# By using the EDSIM51 simulator to code an 8051 microcontroller, the user is asked to enter a passcode, it then checks to see if the passcode entered is the same as the passcode previously saved to meemory, and either grants or denies access.
# The microcontroller is coded to produce LED animations, and to show each message via the LCD and UART.
